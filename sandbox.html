                    <p>Skittles is my 9 year old's cat.<br>
                    We got her in July after trying to have a dog<br>
                    I realized that I am not a dog person after<br>
                    having a dog, so we got Skittles to help my 9 year old<br>
                    deal better with the loss of the dog. She is <br>
                    only about 5 months old and loves cuddles</p>
