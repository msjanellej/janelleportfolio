                <p> My name is Janelle Johnson. Pronouns: She/Her/Hers.<br>
                    After spending over 15 years in retail management, I made the decision<br>
                    to become a software developer. I have years of leadership experience<br>
                    and business knowledge that I bring with me into this new career.<br>
                    As a retail manager, you must be a creative problem solver and have<br>
                    strong change management skills. The ability to prioritze and understand<br>
                    shifting priorities in a work environment have aided me in learning to code.<br></p>
                    <p>What I love most about coding is the ability to make something new out of<br>
                    nothing, and the ability to challenge my way of thinking and learn something<br>
                    new every day. I am passionate about finding solutions to problems and the <br>
                    adreniline rush that comes with it.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not working you can find me reading,watching anime, or spoiling.<br>
                    my three cats. I alsolike to cook, spend time with family, travel, making art,
                    or spending time with friends.<br></p>
                    <p>I also have a deep love of Japan and Japanese culture that started when I was<br>
                    a young child. Believe it or not, I didn't even get into anime until a few years ago,<br>  
                    even though that is one of the most common introductions to Japanese culture for<br>
                    most people.I have taken one year of Japanese language, and hope to some day become fluent.<br>
                    My dream is spend a year living in Japan at some point. I haven't been able to travel<br>
                    there yet, but hope to plan my first trip sometime in the next year or two.</p>
